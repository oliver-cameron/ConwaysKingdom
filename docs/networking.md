# Networking

Both sides hold a copy of the world and run the same deterministic step. The client holds less of it — roughly its viewport and a margin — and advances it locally. The server is authoritative and is consulted only for what a client cannot derive:

1. other players' actions,
2. changes with no local cause,
3. chunks the client does not hold, when its viewport moves.

## Transport

WebSocket, over axum, serving the browser client and the socket from **one origin and one port**. No second static-file server and no cross-origin question.

One task owns the world and the tick; connections reach it through channels. That keeps the simulation single-threaded with a fixed ordering, which is what determinism needs — a mutex shared between connection tasks would make the order actions land in depend on scheduling.

The client's socket runs on its own thread with its own runtime and talks to the app over channels, because making a winit event loop async to accommodate a socket would be the tail wagging the dog. The browser has neither threads nor sockets to give tokio, so `net/link_web.rs` is a second implementation over `web_sys::WebSocket` behind the same `Link` surface: callbacks push into a queue the app drains each frame.

## Frames

Postcard over **binary** websocket messages. Binary because a chunk is raw cell bytes and a UTF-8 round trip would mangle it; postcard because it embeds no field names, so a `ChunkData` frame is barely larger than the chunk. Round-trip tested both directions, and garbage decodes to an error rather than a panic.

## Messages

```rust
enum ClientMessage {
    Join { name },
    Act(Stamped),                              // an action, with player and tick
    Subscribe { chunks }, Unsubscribe { chunks },
    Checkpoint { tick, chunks: Vec<(ChunkId, u64)> },
}

enum ServerMessage {
    Welcome { you, tick }, Rejected { reason },
    Actions(Vec<Stamped>),
    ChunkData { tick, chunk, cells },
    Resync { tick, chunks },
}
```

A chunk is identified by **where it is** — `type ChunkId = Coord`. There is no id to allocate, keep unique, or reconcile after a reconnect; two peers naming the same coordinate mean the same chunk. On a torus, fold with `World::canonical` before comparing.

Actions are stamped with a player and a tick, so replay lands at the same point in the sequence on every peer. They are not raw keystrokes: input resolves to a world effect before it goes on the wire, so the server validates an intent rather than replaying a keyboard.

## Joining

On `Welcome` the client **adopts the server's tick**. That is not cosmetic — a birth's owner is seeded from the generation, so a client simulating at a different tick would make different choices from identical cells and desync immediately.

It then subscribes to the chunks its viewport covers plus a margin, so life entering from off screen is already held rather than popping in late.

A client always opens with a world to look at and replaces it on `Welcome`. A socket object exists long before it connects and may never connect at all, so its mere existence is no reason to blank the view — a client that never connects would otherwise sit on an empty world and look broken.

## Prediction and desync

The client applies its own actions immediately **and** sends them, rather than sending and awaiting. The rules are deterministic and the server runs the same `net::apply` and charges by the same `net::value_delta`, so acting immediately shows the right answer a round trip early.

`Checkpoint` carries **per-chunk** digests. A whole-world digest could never have worked: a client holds only what its viewport covers, so it would disagree every time. The server answers with just the chunks that differ, and silence means agreement.

`cargo run --example join -- ws://…` joins, takes what the server sends, checkpoints it back, and prints MATCH or the chunks that disagree.

## Not done yet

Territory limits on where a player may place, and any authority over the actions the server accepts beyond affordability.
